This repo is a collection of lessons from the Spring 2021 version [Reporting with Data in R](https://utdata.github.io/rwdir/). The book is due to be reworked, so chapter names and numbers may change.

It is also an example used for the 2021 Center for Health Journalism Data Fellowship.

## Published notebooks

- Using Tidycensus to find broadband availability in Texas
- COVID-19 Deaths per population by Texas counties

Running these notebooks requires an Census API Key, which is outlined in the book.
